# Robotic-Arm

## The goal of the project was to study the behaviour of a 4-dof robotic arm/

To simulate the robotic arm , we used Matlab with Corke's robotic toolbox.

### Model the robotic arm
The first was the modeling of the robot in the simulated environment and the definition of 
the necessary parameters ( links between motors, masses , inertias etc.)
